# JobTracker
This is an application of my own design. When given an excel template to aid in tracking jobs that I have 
applied for, I thought, why not make an application that could do this all for me?
This project required a lot of individual study of XAML and the MVVM model in order to construct it.
This is what I have so far as it is still currently being built! Anyone with any advice or tips on how to make this application better, please let me know! Enjoy.



P.S. Some running To-Do's as of right now:

- Add the manage page so users can delete unwanted Postions, Locations, and Recruiters they decided to save.
- Clean up design and alignment of textboxes
- Go through and search for fields/methods I am no longer using or were never utilized.
- Implement an application tracking process. People should be able to check a box if they've applied. It'll allow
them to add some application details then add that specific job to an applied-to list sorted with dates. (right now relying on comments for this)
